    <!--
    Requirements Question:
    Which behavior do I want?
    1. First key press initializes game but is not counted as a guess - not in rubric
    2. First key press is counted as the first guess of a game already initialized -suggested by rubric
        1. must choose word to be guessed and display it before first key press
        2. must restart game at win or loss

    How Should "press any key to begin" behave?
    1. Stay on screen throughout gameplay? Start with (1) but do (2) as bonus
    2. Appear with new game initialization, but disappear (or be replaced with other text) during play
